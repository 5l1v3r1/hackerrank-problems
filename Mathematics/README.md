## nCr
This is a mathematics challenge from hackerrank. The goal is to print the nth line of the Pascal triangle thus poviding the number of combination of nCr with 0 <= r <= n.  
I tried to solve this problem using the C language [Problem link](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ncr-table/problem).  
As of September 12<sup>th</sup>, 2018 :
- [X] Find a first working solution on the sample input
- [X] Submitted solution. Got Floating point exception: 8 as the number gets bigger
- [X] Find a second working solution on the sample input
- [X] Submitted solution. Got wrong answer
- [X] Find a third working solution on the sample input. Solution cannot include division as we lose precision. Remaining way is to build the Pascal Triangle.
- [X] Submitted solution. Got correct
- [X] Challenge solved
