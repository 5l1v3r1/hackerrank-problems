# Hackerrank Mathematics
This repository contains all problems I solved from the hacker rank website regarding Mathematics

## nCr
This is a mathematics challenge from hackerrank. The goal is to print the nth line of the Pascal triangle thus poviding the number of combination of nCr with 0 <= r <= n.  
I tried to solve this problem using the C language [Problem link](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ncr-table/problem).  
As of September 12<sup>th</sup>, 2018 :
- [X] Find a first working solution on the sample input
- [X] Submitted solution. Got Floating point exception: 8 as the number gets bigger
- [X] Find a second working solution on the sample input
- [X] Submitted solution. Got wrong answer
- [X] Find a third working solution on the sample input. Solution cannot include division as we lose precision. Remaining way is to build the Pascal Triangle.
- [X] Submitted solution. Got correct
- [X] Challenge solved

## Coinage
This is a mathematics challenge from hackerrank. The goal is to find the number of combinations of coins to make a certain amount with constraints on the number of coins available.  
I tried to solve this problem using the C language [Problem link](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/coinage/problem).  
As of September 17<sup>th</sup>, 2018 :
- [X] Find a first working solution on the sample input
- [X] Submitted solution. Got Timeout on bigger TestCase
- [X] Find a second working solution on the sample input
- [X] Submitted solution. Got Correct. Solved in O(BxCxD) where B (resp. C and D) is the number of 2 (resp. 5 and 10) coins.
- [X] Find a third working solution on the sample input
- [X] Submitted solution. Got Correct. Solved in O(AxB+CxD) where A (resp. B, C and D) is the number of 1 (resp. 2, 5 and 10) coins.
- [X] Find a fourth working solution on the sample input with hints
- [X] Submitted solution. Got Correct. Solved in O(n)
- [X] Challenge solved

## Find the Point
This is a mathematics challenge from hackerrank. The goal is to find the 180-symetric of a given point p accross another given point q.
